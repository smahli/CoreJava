STRING
___________________

String is non-primitive data types because it references a memory location where data is stored in the heap memory (or String Cnstant Pool) i.e. it,
refrences to a memory where an object is actually placed. And thus the variable of a non primitive data type is also called refrence data types or 
object reference variable. This object refrence variables lives on the stack memory and the object to which it points always lives on the heap memory
the stack holds a pointer to the object on the heap. Thus all non- primitive data types are simply called which are created by instatiting a class.
1.String is a non primitive data types
2.String is the sequence of characters (Array of characters)
	char [] c ={'s', 'h','i','w'}    //CharSequence (Interface)

3.String is a class.
	public final class String extends Object Implements CharSequence,Serialisable,Comparable {
		
	}

4.	 1. String s = new String(); // this s object is IMMUTABLE object

       	2. String s = "Shiwshankar"  // this will also create object
				// what is the difference between line 1 and line 2 why line 2 is more used
5.To create String , There are three classes :
	1. String
	 2.StringBuffer 
	3.StringBuilder
