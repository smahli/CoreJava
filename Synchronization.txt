Sunchronization  Introduction


_________________________________

It is the process by which we control the accessability of multiple threads 
to a particular shared resource


2. Problem which can occur without synchronization:
	1. data inconsistancy
	2. Thread interference 


3. Advantages of synchronization :
	1. No data inconsistancy 
	2. No thread interference 

4. Disadvantages of synchronization:

	1. Increases the wating time period of threads 
	2. Create performance problems 
	3.Deadlock

To overcome synchronization disadvantages , java provides pne package i.e. java.util.concurrent




TYpes of Synchronization


1. Process Synchronization (Not present in Java MultiThreading )
2. Thread Synchronization 
	1.Mutual Exclusive 
		Can be achieved by 3 Ways 
		1. By Synchronization Method
		2. By Synchronization
		3. By Static Synchronization

	2.Coopration
		Can be achieved by following methods of object class
		wait()
		notify()
		notifyAll()






This Example Code Explains Why we need Synchronization



import java.lang.Thread;
public class BookTheatreSeat {
    int totalSeat =10;
    void bookSeat(int seat){
        if (totalSeat>=seat){
            System.out.println("Seats Booked Successfully");
            totalSeat=totalSeat-seat;
            System.out.println(totalSeat+" Seats left");

        }

        else{
            System.out.println(totalSeat+" Seats Left");
            System.out.println("Seat Cannot be booked");
        }

    }
}
class MovieBookAPP extends Thread{
    static BookTheatreSeat b;
    int seats;
    @Override
    public void run() {

        b.bookSeat(seats);

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        b= new BookTheatreSeat();
        MovieBookAPP obj = new MovieBookAPP();
        obj.seats=6;
        obj.start();

        MovieBookAPP amit = new MovieBookAPP();
        amit.seats=7;
        amit.start();

    }                   // Data Inconsistency is occurring in this program
}
