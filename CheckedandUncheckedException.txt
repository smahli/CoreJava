Checked Exception : At the time of compilation Compiler will catch the exception and throw
an exception thereofore this checked exception or compile time exception

unchecked Exception At the time of Compilation compiler will not check but at the 
Runtime It will be caught and thrown an exception that is why this is called 
runntime exception or Unchecked exception


please understand by below example

import java.io.FileInputStream;


public class CheckedAndUnchecked {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try{

        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("c:/file.txt");  // checked exception compile time compiler will throw
                                                                        // an exception before run the program so this is
                                                                        // compile time exception or checked exception
        }
        catch ( Exception e){
            System.out.println(e);
        }

        int a,b,c;
        a=100; b=0;
        c=a/b;
        System.out.println(c);    // it will compile successfully but at runtime this will throw an exception divide by zero
                                    // therefore this is run time exception or unchecked exception
    }
}
