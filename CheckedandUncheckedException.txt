Checked Exception : At the time of compilation Compiler will catch the exception and throw
an exception thereofore this checked exception or compile time exception

unchecked Exception At the time of Compilation compiler will not check but at the 
Runtime It will be caught and thrown an exception that is why this is called 
runntime exception or Unchecked exception


please understand by below example

import java.io.FileInputStream;


public class CheckedAndUnchecked {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try{

        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("c:/file.txt");  // checked exception compile time compiler will throw
                                                                        // an exception before run the program so this is
                                                                        // compile time exception or checked exception
        }
        catch ( Exception e){
            System.out.println(e);
        }

        int a,b,c;
        a=100; b=0;
        c=a/b;
        System.out.println(c);    // it will compile successfully but at runtime this will throw an exception divide by zero
                                    // therefore this is run time exception or unchecked exception
    }
}

1. Chekced exceptions are the exceptions that are checked          1. Unchecked Exceptions are the exceptios that are 
and handles  at the compoile time 				      not checked at the compile time.

2. The program gives a compilation error if a method throws        2. The program compiles fine because compiler is not able to
   a checked exception						       check the exception.

3.If some code within a method throws a checked exception,         3. A method is not forced by compiler to declare the unchecked exceptions
   then the method  must either handle the exception or it 	      thrown by its implementation. Generally , such methods almost always
   must specify the exception using throws keyword		       do not declare them, as well

4. A checked exceptions occur when the chances of failure are      4. Unchecked exceptions occurs mostly due to programming mistakes
   too high.

5. They are direct subclass of Exception class but do not          5. They are direct subclass of Runtime Exception class.
