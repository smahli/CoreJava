MULTITASKING
__________________

Performing multiple task at single time. It increases the performance of cpu

We can achieve multi tasking by Two ways 
1. Process based multitasking 
2. Thread based multitasking 



MULTIPLE PROCESSING     : when one system is connected to multiple processor in order to complete its task
___________________


MultiThreading  :     executing multiple task(sub process or thread) at the same time 


		Uses of multithreading example games, animation and software 

Multithreading is best suitable at programming level

Java provides predefined API for multithtreading.

Difference between thread and process 

	process 					Thread

1. An program which is in execution stage	1. It is subpart of the process(task)

2. Process is HEAVY weigth			2. thread is LIGHT weigth

3 It takes more time for  CONTEXT SWITCHING 	3. It takes less time for CONTEXT SWITCHING

4.Communication It takes more time 		4. Takes less time for in INTERTHREAD communication
for INTERPROCESS communication 

5. Each process has different ADDRESS SPACE	5. Threads share same ADDRESS SPACE 

6. process does not depend on other process	6. Threads depend on each other 
	(all individual ) DEPENDENCY		

7. Process does not require SYNCHRONIZATION 	7. Requires SYNCHRONIZATION

8. process requires more RESOURCE  CONSUMPTION 	8. requires less RESOURCE CONSUMPTION

9. requires more time creation 			9. requires less time creation 

10. Requires more time termination 		10. requires less time termination
