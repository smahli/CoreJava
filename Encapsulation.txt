			ENCAPSULATION	
 		      _________________

Encapsulation in java is a mechanism of wrapping tha data(variable) and code acting 
on the data(methods) together as a  single unit.

Steps to achieve encapsulation
1.Declare the variables of a class as private.
2. Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

In encapsulation , the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes,
and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. this concept is known as Data Hiding.
