		ABSTACTION
		_______________
Abstraction is hiding internal implementation and just highlighting the setup services that we are offering.

Achieved by 
	Abtract Class(0-100%)
	Interfaces (100%)

	1. A method without body(no  implementation) is known as abstract method.
	2. A method must always be declared in an abstract class, or we can say that
	if a class has an abstract method , it should be declared abstract as well.
	3.If a regular class extends an abstract class, then the class must have to implement
	all the abstract methods of abstract parebt class or it has to be declared abstract as well. 
	4.Abstract methods in an abstract class are meant to be overriden in derived 
	concrete classes otherwise compile time error will be thrown.
	5. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated , means we can;;'t create an object of Abtract class.
