we use static with
1. variable(we don't use with local variable)
2. methods 
3. block
4. inner class (don't use with outer class)


static variables belong to the class not object


When a variable is declared as static , then a single copy if variable is
created and shared among all objects at class level.Thus comapany name 
i.e freelancer will be shared among s1 , s2 and all the objetcs
