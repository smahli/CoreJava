we use static with
1. variable(we don't use with local variable)
2. methods 
3. block
4. inner class (don't use with outer class)


static variables belong to the class not object


When a variable is declared as static , then a single copy if variable is
created and shared among all objects at class level.Thus comapany name 
i.e freelancer will be shared among s1 , s2 and all the objetcs


The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.


public class CountTest {
    static int count=0;        //   if int count =0 is there then what will happen
    CountTest(){
        count++;
        System.out.println(count);       //  output will change because of static variable
                                        // static variable belong to the class not object so static will print 1 2 3
                                        // if static will not be there then only 1 1 1 will be printed because every time count will with initialised with 0

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountTest c1= new CountTest();
        CountTest c2= new CountTest();
        CountTest c3= new CountTest();

    }
}
