          POLYMORPHISM
        _________________

Many forms
Example Water has different forms
Shapes has diffrent forms 
sound has diffrent form

Two Types Polymorphism 
	1.Compile time polymorphism( Static Polymorphism) achieved vy method overloading  handled by Compiler

	2.Run Time Polymorphism(Dynamic Polymorphism) achieved by Method overriding  handled by JVM


Method Overloading
1. same method name
2. method should be in same class
3. diffrent argument
	number of argument
	sequence of argument
	type of argument


Method Overriding
1. same name
2. diffrent class 
3. same arguments
4.Inheritance (IS-A Relationship)
